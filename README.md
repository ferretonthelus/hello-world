# hello-world
for learning to rule MY world!
First of all. I Love my wife of 27 years at this time.
I love Robots and all the differant ways to make them tick. 
EZ Robot is one of the coolest producers/groups of bot building parts/people.
I like Astronomy. It astounds me to be able to see Jupiter sitting out there millions of miles...Ans I can SEE it! And others.
I have just started learning 3D printing.
My wife bought me a Photon S, and a HUGE Xinkebot ORCAII Cygna with all the bells and whistles. (she said she had coupons) (I don't know how she finds coupons for 3D Printers!?? Anyways...
I love the martial arts and those in it for the spiritual part. I dislike bullies of any type.
I love My cats
I believe in Murphy's Laws. I have experienced them too many times to count!
